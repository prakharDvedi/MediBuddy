-- Storage RLS for the private "documents" bucket.
-- Path convention: {user_id}/{case_id}/{document_id}-{filename}
-- so the first folder segment is always the owning user's auth.uid().

-- RLS is already enabled on storage.objects by Supabase itself; the
-- migration role doesn't own the table so re-enabling it would fail.
